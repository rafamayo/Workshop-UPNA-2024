# Lab 3

In this lab we will work with the very important FHIR concept of references.

## References in FHIR

References between resources in FHIR always go in one direction only. For example, observations have a reference to the corresponding subject to which the observation applies (e.g. a patient), but the patient has no references to any observations.

This is an optimization because when new observations are made, the patient does not need to be updated. The same applies, for example, to the relationship between doctor and patient: the patient has a reference to the doctor (general practitioner), but the doctor has no reference to his patients.

A resource's possible references can easily be identified in the documentation. For example in the patient's case:

## Types of references

In FHIR there are two different types of references: literal and logical (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/references.html#Reference). Basically we can define the two types of references as follows:
+ literal references are references between two well defined FHIR resources, where the URI of both linked resources is known and the system can resolve the resources.
+ logical references are used when the referenced resource may not well known and cannot be readily resolved. For example because the resource resides in a system that does not expose a RESTful API. This might happen when working with legacy systems.

For the purposes of this lab we will work with literal references.

### Part 4: Linking the patient to the practitioner

The patient we created in part 3 of lab 2 is being treated by the practitioner we created in part 2. To link them, we create a reference on the patient pointing to the practitioner resource. The documentation of the Patient resource (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html#resource) shows the possible references of this resource. One of them is a reference to the Practitioner:

![Referencing the practitioner from the patient](/assets/FHIR_reference_practitioner.png)

1. What other references are possible? Can you find them.

We will update our patient with a reference to the practioner. To do that we will need the Practioner's id (this was automatically assigned by the server). We suppose that we know the practitioner's name (maybe selected from a drop-down box in our web application) and will use the name as search parameter.

```python
import json
from fhirclient import client

import fhirclient.models.patient as pat
import fhirclient.models.humanname as hn
import fhirclient.models.address as ad
import fhirclient.models.organization as org
import fhirclient.models.codeableconcept as codecon
import fhirclient.models.coding as cod
import fhirclient.models.practitioner as prac
import fhirclient.models.contactpoint as cp
import fhirclient.models.fhirreference as ref 

def pretty(js):
# pretty print a json object
    return json.dumps(js, indent=2)


settings = {
    'app_id': 'my_web_app',
    'api_base': 'http://localhost:8080/fhir' # you can change this to match your FHIR server endpoint
}

myClient = client.FHIRClient(settings=settings)


print('***\nPart 4: Update the patient with a reference to the practitioner\n***')

# Search for the practitioner on the server. We know the practitioner's name "Smith"
search = prac.Practitioner.where(struct={'name':'Owens'})
practitioners = search.perform_resources(myClient.server)
for practitioner in practitioners:
    print(pretty(practitioner.as_json()))
    
# The patient has a reference to his general practitioner
# We create the reference and use the returned paractioner's id
generalpractitioner = ref.FHIRReference()
generalpractitioner.reference = 'Practitioner/' + practitioners[0].id
generalpractitioner.type = 'Practitioner'


# show the reference object
print("The reference object (LOCAL):")
print(pretty(generalpractitioner.as_json()))

# Now that we have the reference object created, we assign this reference object to the corresponding attribute of the patient
# First let's get the patient. Our patient is Will Byers, let's get him from the server. 
search = pat.Patient.where(struct={'given':'Will', 'family':'Byers'})
patients = search.perform_resources(myClient.server)
for patient in patients:
    print(pretty(patient.as_json()))

# We assume that we only have one Will Byers, our patient is in patients[0]
patient = patients[0]
# Let's check that everything is correct
print("Patient's id: " + patient.id)
print("Patient's name: " + myClient.human_name(patient.name[0]))

# Now we update the patient with the reference to the practitioner
# Note from the documentation, that there could be more than one practitioner, hence the list
patient.generalPractitioner = [generalpractitioner]
# What does the patient look like right now?
print("The updated patient (LOCAL): ")
print(pretty(patient.as_json()))

# Perform the update on the server
result = patient.update(myClient.server)
# Show the result of the request
print("The updated patient (REMOTE): ")
print("Result of the update:")
print(pretty(result))
```

You can check that it worked by performing a GET with the REST client or directly on the browser 

## Search with references

The resource Practitioner does not know her patients (has no reference to her patients). For a particular practitioner, how might we look for her patients? To do this, we look up the documentation for Patient and find the general-practitioner parameter in the Search Parameters section (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html#search).

We can then do a search like this:

```
GET {{FHIR_URL}}/Patient?general-practitioner=Practitioner/<practitioner id>
```
  
In `<practitioner id>` we put the known id of the resource practitioner. As a result, we get a bundle containing all patients whose practitioner is the indicated one. Of course, we might have to search for the practiotioner first to get her id. Or maybe we obtained her id in some other way (e.g. it was entered in a form).

We can also do chained searches. For example if we knew the name of the practitioner, we could search for all patients whose paractioner has a specific name. A chained search would look like this:

```
GET {{FHIR_URL}}/Patient?general-practitioner:Practitioner.name=<practitioner name>
```

The important idea with the chained search is that the symbol `.` gives access to the search parameters of the referenced resource (in this case the Practioner). So for example we could do this:

```
GET {{FHIR_URL}}/Patient?general-practitioner:Practitioner._id=<practitioner id>
```
which is the same as the first search.

In a chained search we can even combine several search parameters using the symbol `&` as usual.


## A scenario

We want to model the following scenario to try out some of the things we've learned:

![A FHIR scenario](/assets/FHIR_Scenario.png)

Here some ideas of what you could do:
+ There is one practioner
+ The practitioner belongs to a hospital (organization)
+ There are a couple of patients
+ The patients (some or all of them) get some tests done (more than one), which are documented as observations
+ The observations should have a date (this might be a bit tricky!)
+ You should use a coding system such as LOINC for the observations
+ The observations could be
  + Blood in sugar
  + C reactive protein in serum or plasma
  + Bilirubin in urine test
+ The Organization performing the observations is a lab (different from the hospital)

You can also use the synthea dataset as a starting point and complete it with the missing resources and references. #

After you have created your resources on the server you could try to answer the following questions using FHIR interactions:
+ What patients does our practitioner have?
+ What observations does a specific patient have?
+ For a specific patient, what observations where performed by a specific performer? On a specific date?

Can you think of other useful searches?
