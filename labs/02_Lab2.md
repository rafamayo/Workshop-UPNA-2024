# Lab 2

## Introduction

In this exercise you will set up an example FHIR server, fill it with patient data and do some simple tasks with the server.

For this exercise, the FHIR server runs inside a Docker container. Docker is already installed and ready to use on your virtual machine.

## Download and start the container
Docker is set up on the virtual machine and should start upon login. However, it may take some time until it is ready.

**Note:** The Docker desktop does not need to be started.

Bring up a *Command Prompt Window (cmd)* and run the container:

```bash
docker run -dp 8080:8080 hapiproject/hapi:latest
```

In case that the container is not present on your machine, you can download the latest version of the FHIR server container with the command

```bash
docker pull hapiproject/hapi:latest
```

Now the FHIR Base should be available and you can try searching for patients:

`http://localhost:8080/fhir/patient`

The response should contain "total": 0 patients. The server is empty!

Further information about the HAPI FHIR implementation can be found here: https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter

## Task 1 - Examining our server

First we want to find out what our server can do. We can find out by looking at the response of the metadata request. This is possible directly via the URL: `http://localhost:8080/fhir/metadata` or using a REST client to perform a GET request.

The CapabilityStatement is very long (how many lines?). It contains a list of all supported resources.

1. Look for the following meta information: What is the version of the server?
2. Which status of the FHIR standard is implemented?

A combination of resources that is very common and useful is the triplet `"Patient"/"Encounter"/"Diagnostic Report"`. This combination is used, for example, to model an `Encounter` in which a `Patient` undergoes an examination the result thereof gets documented in a `DiagnosticReport`.

3. Can you find the relevant resources in the capability statement?

In the description of each of these resources there are very interesting fields such as "searchParam". What does this mean?


## Task 2 - Filling our server with patient data

In order to be able to work meaningfully with the server, we have to fill it with patient data. There are different possibilities for this. We use synthea to generate sample patients. https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea

We use the “Basic Setup and Running instructions”: https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Basic-Setup-and-Running. To be able to generate resources you need to download the program to your personal drive in a subdirectory "eHealth/Synthea". https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/releases/download/master-branch-latest/synthea-with-dependencies.jar

Now we can generate (for example) 20 patients with the patient generator. See the page linked above instructions and examples of how to do this. Use the default settings.

```java
java -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar -p 20
```

Note: the patients are generated according to the US profile. It is possible to use international profiles (https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea-international). For our current purposes, however, the default settings are sufficient.

Now we have to upload the patients to the server. For this we use the following python script [upload_fhir_bundle.py](https://github.com/rafamayo/Workshop-UPNA-2023/blob/main/upload_fhir_bundle.py)

Download the script into the subdirectory "eHealth/FHIR-uploader".

Caution: In the script check that the "FHIR Server endpoint" and the path to the patient files matches your configuration!

Now you can run the script from the "eHealth/FHIR-uploader" directory.

```python
python upload-fhir-bundle.py
```
The python package 'requests' must be installed. You can install it with `pip install requests`

If everything was successful, you should now have patients on your local server. You could now repeat the taks from Lab 1 with your own server.

## Task 3 - Setting up a client

Using a REST client is a good thing for test purposes when developing an API. In the context of FHIR we can use a REST client to learn about the basic capabilities of the standard. However when you want to implement a productive solution you will want to work with FHIR from *within* a programming language.  

There are client implementations for different programming languages. Here we will use the python client from SMART. The client documentation is here: http://docs.smarthealthit.org/client-py/

The HAPI Server requires version 4.0.0 of the SMART fhir client, but pip (usually) installs version 3.2.0. The correct version must be installed manually. The repository can be found here: https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/client-py. The instructions to get the distribution running are here: https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/client-py#building-distribution

You need to do the following: clone the repository to your local machine, change into the root folder of the package and run the following commands to build the distribution

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py sdist
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```

Then you install the module by running this:

```python
python setup.py install
```

This way the correct version will be installed. You can check the installed version with

```python
pip list
```


## Task 4 - Using the python client

Now we use the python client to perform some tasks on our own FHIR server

### Part 1: Create an organization

We will start by creating an organization (a healthcare service provider). The FHIR resource is here: http://hl7.org/fhir/organization.html

```python
import json
from fhirclient import client

import fhirclient.models.address as ad
import fhirclient.models.organization as org
import fhirclient.models.codeableconcept as codecon
import fhirclient.models.coding as cod

def pretty(js):
# pretty print a json object
    return json.dumps(js, indent=2)


settings = {
    'app_id': 'my_web_app',
    'api_base': 'http://localhost:8080/fhir' # you can change this to match your FHIR server endpoint
}

myClient = client.FHIRClient(settings=settings)

print('***\nPart 1: Create an Organization\n***')

# Create the empty organization
organization = org.Organization()
organization.active = True
organization.name = 'Hawkins National Laboratory' 

codeableconcept = codecon.CodeableConcept()
coding = cod.Coding()
coding.code = 'prov'
coding.display = 'Healthcare service provider - Laboratory'
coding.system = 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/organization-type'
codeableconcept.coding = [coding]
codeableconcept.text = 'Type of healthcare service provider'
organization.type = [codeableconcept]

address = ad.Address()
address.text = '1 Laboratory Drive, 99999 Hawkins, USA'
address.postalCode = '99999'
address.city = 'Hawkins'
address.country = 'USA'
organization.address = [address]

# show the organization so far
print("The organization so far (LOCAL):")
print(pretty(organization.as_json()))

# Now create the organization on the server
# This is whre the interaction with the server is going to take place 
result = organization.create(myClient.server)
# show the returned result
print("Result from the creation transaction (REMOTE): ")
print(pretty(result))
print("Returned orgaization id: " + str(result["id"]))
```

### Part 2: Create a practitioner locally and show it

```python
import json
from fhirclient import client

import fhirclient.models.humanname as hn
import fhirclient.models.address as ad
import fhirclient.models.practitioner as prac
import fhirclient.models.contactpoint as cp

def pretty(js):
# pretty print a json object
    return json.dumps(js, indent=2)


settings = {
    'app_id': 'my_web_app',
    'api_base': 'http://localhost:8080/fhir' # you can change this to match your FHIR server endpoint
}

myClient = client.FHIRClient(settings=settings)

print('***\nPart 2: Create a new Practitioner\n***')

# create the empty practitioner
practitioner = prac.Practitioner()
practitioner.active = True
name = hn.HumanName()
name.given = ['Sam']
name.family = 'Owens'
name.prefix = ['Dr.']
name.use = 'official'
practitioner.name = [name]
address = ad.Address()
address.city = 'Hawkins'
address.country = 'USA'
address.text = '1 Laboratory Drive, 99999 Hawkins, USA'
address.postalCode = '99999'
practitioner.address = [address]
telecom = cp.ContactPoint()
telecom.system = 'phone'
telecom.value = '055512345589'
practitioner.telecom = [telecom]

# show the practitioner so far
print("The practitioner so far (LOCAL):")
print(pretty(practitioner.as_json()))

#
# Create the practitioner in the server
#
result = practitioner.create(myClient.server)
# show the returned result
print("Result from the creation transaction (REMOTE): ")
print(pretty(result))
print("Returned practitioner id: " + str(result["id"]))
```

### Part 3: Create a basic patient

```python
import json
from fhirclient import client

import fhirclient.models.patient as pat
import fhirclient.models.humanname as hn
import fhirclient.models.address as ad


def pretty(js):
# pretty print a json object
    return json.dumps(js, indent=2)


settings = {
    'app_id': 'my_web_app',
    'api_base': 'http://localhost:8080/fhir' # you can change this to match your FHIR server endpoint
}

myClient = client.FHIRClient(settings=settings)


print('***\nPart 3: Create a new Patient\n***')

# create the empty patient
patient = pat.Patient()
# give the patient a name
name = hn.HumanName()
name.given = ['Will']
name.family = 'Byers'
name.use = 'official'
patient.name = [name]
address = ad.Address()
address.city = 'Hawkins'
address.country = 'USA'
address.text = '221 Mirkwood, 99999 Hawkins, USA'
address.postalCode = '99999'
patient.address = [address]
patient.gender = 'male'

# show the patient so far
print("The patient so far (LOCAL):")
print(pretty(patient.as_json()))

# Create the patient on the server
result = patient.create(myClient.server)
# show the returned result
print("Result from the creation transaction (REMOTE): ")
print(pretty(result))
print("Returned patient id: " + str(result["id"]))
```

You can also perform these tasks using the REST client.
