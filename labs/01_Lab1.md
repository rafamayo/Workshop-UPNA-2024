# Lab 1

## Introduction

In this lab we will deal with the basics of the FHIR communication standard. FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is published by HL7 and is a modern healthcare communication standard that combines the best features of HL7 v2, HL7 v3 and CDA. The standard uses the latest web technologies with a focus on simplicity in implementation.

The present lab has the following learning objectives:
+ read and apply the FHIR specification
+ understand the basics of the FHIR standard
+ identify appropriate resources for a use case
+ create and modify resources
+ interact with an FHIR server via REST
+ use FHIR operations
+ work with terminologies

The use case we are *simulating* in this lab ist that of an app which:
+ can search for and read patient data on an FHIR server
+ can update/supplement patient data on an FHIR server
+ can add new patients to the FHIR server

## Required tools and infrastructure:
+ Web browser
     + Firefox or Chrome
+ REST client
     + For example Postman https://www.postman.com/downloads/
+ Test FHIR Server
     + [List of available test servers](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Public+Test+Servers)
     + For example: http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4
+ Current version of the FHIR specification
     + http://hl7.org/fhir/

## Task 1 - Selecting appropriate resources and transactions for the scenario

The first thing to consider when implementing a scenario with FHIR is which resources will be required for the use case. In the documentation there is an overview of all available resources: http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/resourcelist.html. These are the modular components which will be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical and administrative problems in healthcare.

In our simple use case we want to work with **patients**, so this will be the main required resource. All resource documentation pages have the same basic structure (The documentation of the *Patient* resource is here: http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/patient.html):

![An example resource *Patient*](/assets/FHIR_patient_resource_summary_labeled.png)

It is a good idea to start by considering the following aspects when deciding which resource to use: 

+ *Scope and Usage*: describes when and for what the resource should be used. http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/patient.html#scope
+ *Examples*: provides several possible concrete example implmentations of the resource. http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/patient-examples.html
+ *Profiles and extensions*: rules and additional information items which might be required in certain scenarios. http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/patient-profiles.html
+ *Maturity level* of the resource: used by implementers to judge how advanced and stable a resource is. http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/versions.html#maturity

## Interacting with the resources: RESTful API

Another aspect to consider is which interactions are we going to need for the scenario, i.e. what kind of data are we going to create and manipulate and how are we going to do that. FHIR is a RESTful specification and that means that the transactions are performed directly on the server resource using an HTTP request/response model. FHIR supports CRUD (create, read, update and delete, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create%2C_read%2C_update_and_delete) interactions organized into different interaction levels:

+ instance-related `[base]/[type]/[id] ...`
     + read ( GET ): Read the current state of a resource
     + vread ( GET ): Read the state of a specific version of the resource
     + update ( PUT ): Update an existing resource by its id (or create it if it is new)
     + patch ( PATCH ): Update an existing resource by posting a set of changes to it
     + delete ( DELETE ): Delete a resource
     + history ( GET ): Retrieve the change history for a particular resource
+ type-related `[base]/[type] ...`
     + create ( POST ): Creation of a new resource with a server assigned id
     + search ( GET ): Search for resources of a type based on filter criteria
     + history ( GET ): Retrieve the changes of all resources of a type
+ system-related `[base]`
     + Capabilities ( GET ): Retrieve the information about a server's capabilities
     + Batch/transaction ( POST ): Process multiple resources in a single interaction
     + History ( GET ): Read the history of all resources
     + Search ( GET ): Search for resources based on a criterion independent of the resource type

Further information about the RESTful API can be found here: https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html

1. Identify appropriate resources for the patient data. Where can you find this information in the documentation?
2. Decide which of the above interactions are required for the scenario


## Task 2 - Searching for resources

There are different ways in which we can perform searches on the resources. We can for example search for all instances of a resource or we can limit the search by using parameters. the syntax is the typical one for HTTP interactions.

To get all the instances of a resource (i.e. a type-related search), we perform a GET on the resource by just using `[base]/[type]`. If we want to use parameters to narrow down the search, then the general syntax is as follows: 

`[base]/[type]?[parameter1]&[parameter2]&[parameter3]...`

Examples of valid parameters are:
+ length=27
+ height=lt163.00
+ date=ge2013-01-01
+ name:exact=Eva
+ name:contains=eva
+ gender:missing=true
+ gender:not=male
+ value=5.4||mg
+ value-quantity=5.4|http://unitsofmeasure.org|mg

Further information onsearching and search parameters can be found here: http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/search.html)

1. Identify the valid search parameters for the Patient resource. Where can you find this information?
2. Test the query [base]/Patient? in the browser. View the results using the HTML XML option (click on the appropriate link of the response).
3. Restrict your search: only search for male/female patients
4. Are there any patients with given name "Eva"?
5. Are there any patients born after 2001-01-01? And before 2001-01-01?
6. What about female patients born exactly on 2001-01-01?
7. Are there any patients living in Boston?
8. Extend the query with the parameter _format=html/xml
9. Test (and save!) the same query in the REST client. Note: With the REST client, no formatting information is required. The formatting is done by the client itself.
10. Configure your REST client with the header `Accept: application/fhir+xml` and save it as a favourite.


## Task 3 - Obtain and analyze search results

Search results are always returned as a *Bundle* resource (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html). The first part of the bundle resource contains metadata. The total attribute indicates the number of search hits. The actual matches (individual resources) are contained within the repeatable  attribute `Bundle.entry.resource`. The address where each resource can be retrieved is in `Bundle.entry.fullUrl`.

### Search results with paging
Servers are free not to return all search results at once for resource reasons. Instead, individual "pages" are created with links to additional results. Clients can specify the page size themselves using the `_count` parameter.

We continue now using the REST client.

1. Run a search with no parameters `[base]/Patient`
How many results did you get? Is there paging? How many individual results do the pages contain?

2. Run the search again and append the parameter `_count=15`. Find the `relation` parameter in the results. The possible values of this parameter are `self`, `next`, `previous`. What do you think that these values mean?

3. How many entries do the different groups contain?

4. Search for patients with the last name "Workshop_UPNA_2023" and retrieve the resource by their URL in XML format.

5. What is the difference between the search and read interactions?


## Task 4 - Updating and Editing Resources

When editing and updating resources, we need to consider the data types of the particular data elements. Primitive data types (e.g. integer, string) only have a value, but no further sub-elements (see below).

![Primitive data types](/assets/FHIR_primitive_types.png)

Complex data types (e.g. Address, HumanName) have sub-elements, either primitive or complex data types (see below).
![Complex data types](/assets/FHIR_General-purpose_complex_data_types.png)

Both primitive and complex data types can be extended with extensions.

The data elements will be represented differently when using XML or JSON.

For example the `count`data element with data type `integer` of the resource `MeasureReport` (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/measurereport.html).
Representation in XML:

```xml
<count value = “2”/>
```

Representation in JSON: 

```json
“count”: 2
```

Similarly for complex data types. For example the data element `address` with data type `Address` of `resource` Patient (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html#resource). 

Representation in XML:

```xml
<address>
     <use value="work"/>
     <text value="Campus Arrosadia ES-31006 Pamplona"/>
     <line value="Campus Arrosadia"/>
     <city value="Pamplona"/>
     <postalCode value="31006"/>
     <country value="ESP"/>
</address>
```

Representation in JSON: 

```json
"address": [
     {
          "use": "work",
          "text": "Campus Arrosadia ES-31006 Pamplona"
          "line": [
               "Campus Arrosadia"
          ],
          "city": "Pamplona",
          "postalCode": "31006",
          "country": "ESP"
     }
]
```


1. Identify appropriate attributes (data elements) for the patient's last name and address. What are their data types?

The Patient "Workshop_UPNA_2023" retrieved in task 3 is quite empty. We are going to update it with some more information. In order to update the patient, you need to perform a new request containing the required information in the request body. 

2. Take the XML resource retrieved in Task 3.4 and paste it into the *Request Body* window of the new transaction. If necessary perform a search or read (if you have the id) again to get the resource (this is when the REST client comes handy, since you can save your requests for later use). 

3. You need to add `Content-Type: application/fhir+xml` to the header of the request. 

4. Now add to the resource description in the body of the request the necessary information. For example you can add the patient's first name and address. 

5. Send the request. What is the required interaction? (look at task 1 if you don't remember)

**Caution:** you need to match the format you specified on the request header to the representation you are using on the request body. If you say `Content-Type: application/fhir+xml` on the header, then the contents of the request body must be represented using XML. On the other hand, if you say `Content-Type: application/fhir+json`, then you need to use the JSON representation.

6. What happens when several transactions update the same resource?


## Task 5 - Creating a new resource and filling it with data

We now create a brand new resource and fill it with data. There are at least two ways of doing this.

+ Create an empty resource, get its id and fill it with the required data.
+ Create a resource already containing information with just one request. 

1. Create a new empty resource of type Patient. What is the required interaction?
The URL indicates the resource type. In the "Body" field we write the structure of the empty resource. We can try this time using JSON as representation format. How do you get access to the newly created resource?

2. Fill in the newly created resource with details of name, gender, address, contact. What interaction do you use for this?

It is also possible to specify the values of various fields when initially creating a resource (using POST).

3. Now create a new patient with POST and with the appropriate information on name, surname, gender, date of birth and address
